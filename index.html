                                American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the "King of Pop", 
                                he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of 
                                the 20th century and one of the greatest entertainers. Jackson's 
                                contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with his publicized
                                 personal life, made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades
                                The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964
                                 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5.
                                  
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                            He began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records, and in the early 1980s, became 
                                            a dominant figure in popular music. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "
                                            Billie Jean", and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial
                                             barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. Their popularity
                                              helped bring the television channel MTV to fame. Bad (1987) was the first album to produce 
                                              five US Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.
